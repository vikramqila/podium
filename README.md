# GatewayKit

GatewayKit is a lightweight, config-driven API gateway. It reads a YAML configuration file,
matches incoming requests to configured routes, applies gateway middleware, and forwards
requests to upstream services.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or newer

## Run

Start the gateway with the sample config:

```bash
go run ./cmd/gatewaykit --config gateway.yaml
```

You can also pass the config path with an environment variable:

```bash
GATEWAY_CONFIG=gateway.yaml go run ./cmd/gatewaykit
```

Expected startup output:

```text
GatewayKit listening on :8080 with 5 routes
```

Health check:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Test

Run the full self-contained test suite:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run with verbose output:

```bash
go test ./... -v
```

Confirm all packages compile:

```bash
go build ./...
```

## Mock Upstreams

The repository includes a simple mock upstream server for manual testing:

```bash
go run ./cmd/mockupstream --port 3001 --name users
```

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /healthz` returns a health response.
- `GET /echo?x=1` returns method, path, query, and service name.
- `GET /slow` waits six seconds before responding.
- `GET /flaky` returns `503` twice, then `200`, repeating every three requests.
- Any other path returns a canned `200` JSON response.

To exercise the sample `gateway.yaml`, start one mock upstream per configured port:

```bash
go run ./cmd/mockupstream --port 3001 --name users
go run ./cmd/mockupstream --port 3002 --name orders
go run ./cmd/mockupstream --port 3003 --name products-a
go run ./cmd/mockupstream --port 3004 --name products-b
go run ./cmd/mockupstream --port 3005 --name legacy
go run ./cmd/mockupstream --port 3006 --name internal
```

Then run the gateway in another terminal:

```bash
go run ./cmd/gatewaykit --config gateway.yaml
```

Example requests:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/users/echo?x=1
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/users
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/internal
curl -i -H 'X-API-Key: sk_live_abc123' http://localhost:8080/api/internal/echo
```

## Behavior Notes

Single `upstream.url` routes proxy directly to their upstream service. Routes using
`upstream.targets` are forwarded with `round_robin` or `weighted_round_robin` selection.
Target selection state is kept in memory per route.

If a configured upstream service is not running, the gateway returns `502 Bad Gateway`.
Upstream requests honor route-level `timeout` first, then `global_timeout`, and return
`504 Gateway Timeout` when exceeded.

Routes configured with `auth.type: api_key` require the configured header to contain one of
the configured keys before proxying.

Fixed-window and sliding-window rate limits are enforced in memory. Route-level limits
override the global limit, and `per: ip` and `per: global` buckets are supported.

Single-upstream routes with `retry` retry configured upstream status codes using fixed or
exponential backoff. Request bodies are buffered so retried requests preserve the original
payload.

## Project Layout

- `cmd/gatewaykit`: CLI entrypoint for the gateway process
- `cmd/mockupstream`: simple mock upstream server for manual testing
- `internal/config`: configuration loading and validation
- `internal/gateway`: HTTP server, routing, auth, rate limits, and request pipeline
- `internal/proxy`: upstream selection, retry handling, and request forwarding
- `gateway.yaml`: sample configuration from the take-home prompt
- `DECISIONS.md`: implementation choices, trade-offs, and deferred work
